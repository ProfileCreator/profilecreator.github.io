## New Features

### Open Source

ProfileCreator is now Open Source under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

I write about this and the reasons why I have to stop developing this application in a blog post here: https://erikberglund.github.io/2019/Profile_Creator_Open_Source/

### Ability to reorder TableView rows.

It's now possible to reorder TableView rows and to add rows directly below the selected row.

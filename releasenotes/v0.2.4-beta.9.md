## Updated Features

#### ProfileManifest Repository

Much work has gone into updating the [ProfileManifest](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileManifests) Repository.

* The [Getting Started](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileManifests/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page is now completed to guide anyone in creating a manifests for ProfileCreator.
* [Manifest Format Version 4](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileManifests/wiki/Manifest-Format-Versions#format-version-4) was added with new keys.

#### Manifest Alias Key

Added an alias to the `pfm_type` value. Now it's possible to write `real` as well as `float` to describe a floating point value type. (https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/issues/86)

#### Checkbox for `pfm_range_list` choice.

A new option was added to allow a `pfm_range_list` with precisely two items in its array to be represented as a checkbox.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug when entering fingerprint with invalid characters in the SCEP payload.
* Fixed a bug where you could only add one item to an array of dictionaries before you had to de-select and re-select the payload to add another.
* Fixed a bug in the base642data value processor where the conversion from data to string sometimes returned nil.
* Fixed a bug where a payload key contained a period (.) at the root of the KeyPath it would be set incorrectly.
* Fixed a bug where the exclusion message was hidden if a text field was larger than 1 line. (https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/issues/87)
* Fixed a bug where the exclusion condition was not updated when a text was entered in text fields. (https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/issues/83)
* Fixed a bug where an array inside a dictionary did not store the entered value correct until you saved, closed and reopened the profile. (https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/issues/82)
* ...and many minor bug fixes. 

## Known Issues

* When a profile is reopened by the application at launch, the application doesn't recognize that it's open and multiple copies of the same profile may be open at the same time.

* When saving a profile for the first time, on rare occasions it might not save and won't be recognized after a restart.
(Never found a way to replicate, only rare reports. If this happens to you, please contact me or file an issue.)

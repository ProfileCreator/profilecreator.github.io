## New Features

### Import Multiple Files

You can now select multiple files when importing to a file view that supports multiple payloads. Each file will then create a new payload.

Useful for adding multiple fonts or certificates.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where importing existing profile or paylosd on 10.14 would crash the app.
- Fixed issue where exporting profiles in the XML content style, or with multiple payloads. The exported file would only include one payload.

## Contribute

If you wish to contribute to this project, the following things are a good starting point:

- Test and report bugs or incorrect behavior both in the UI and in the exported profiles.
- Language and spelling errors. (English is not my native language).
- Missing payloads or payload keys. (Contribute to the ProfileManifests repository to improve the manifests used to define all payloads, keys and their interactions.)
- Add feature requests or suggestions by opening an issue in this repository.

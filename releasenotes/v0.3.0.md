## New Features

### Icon

Thanks to the very generous Tom Bridge and [Technolutionary, LLC](https://www.technolutionary.com), we now have an Icon for ProfileCreator!

The icon is made by the artist Katherine M. Ahern which you can find at her website: [kateahern.com](https://kateahern.com)

### App Updates

From this version and forward the application will show a notification whenever a new version of the app is released. 

And through the Sparkle framework you will also be able to update the application in place without needing to manually download it from GitHub.

### Notes

A text box has been added where the value for the key `pfm_note` will be shown to bring extra attention to some aspect of the payload key.

### Substitution Variables

A new key in the manifest allows the manifest creator to define available substitution variables for the specific key.

Substitution variables are shown in purple and will show a popover when hovering the mouse over them describing the variable and the source for it's replacement.

### Button: Import

An import button is now available for all keys that support drag/drop as a method of importing data for a payload key.

### Button: Remove

A "Remove" button is now available for data payload keys where files can be added. (#156)

### Additional Payload Key Information

Added additional fields to the footer introduced in version 0.2.5:

- Scope (Shows if a payload key is only supported in a subset of the scupes for the entire payload)

### On Demand loading of dynamic local preferences manifests

From this version, the local preferences generated manifest are only loaded if that option is selected from the app preferences.

### Multiple selections in tableview allowed

It is now possible to select multiple rows in a tableview.

### New build versioning system

To comply with the Sparkle framework for updates, the build number `CFBundleVersion` will from now on always be incremented for each release.

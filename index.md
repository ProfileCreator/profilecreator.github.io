# ProfileCreator 0.2.6

## New Features

### Additional Payload Key Information

A new footer for payload keys is shown if there are additional information about that key. 

The following information items are currently supported:

- If the key is only supported from or up to a specific os/app-version.
- URL linking to additional documentation about the key, shown as a small book icon. When clicked it opens this URL in your default web browser. (#135)

### Export to .plist

Now, in addition to exporting profiles you can also export preferences to a .plist.  This makes it easier to import into the Custom Settings payload of an MDM.

This option is only shown when holding the export button in the profile or payload window to bring upp the context menu and choosing "Export Plist".

This will export each enabled payload domain to their own file in the selected folder.

### Export Button in Editor Window

Added an export button to the profile editor window to make exporting the currently open profile easier.

### Export Keyboard Shortcut

The Export menu item now has a keyboard shortcut mapped to `âŒ˜E` (#128)

### Custom ProfileIdentifierFormat & PayloadIdentifierFormat

In the ProfileCreator preferences under 'Advanced', you can specify a custom default format for the `ProfileIdentifier` & `PayloadIdentifier` values.  See [the wiki](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/wiki/Preferences:-Advanced#payload-identifier) for more info. (#55)

The application will rename your profile configuration file (.pfcconf) to match the current value.

**IMPORTANT** As there can't be two files with the same name in a directory, the application will not rename a file if the new name already exists. The file is still saved though, but keeps its old name.

The file rename only occurs when a profile is saved, it does not change every saved file retroactively if the setting is changed.

### New Interface Item: Slider

A slider is now available as an input method for certain payload keys with a predefined list of items to select. See [Use slider as input method](#Use-slider-as-input-method)

### New Interface Item: Combo Box

The app now support keys that allow both custom input and selecting values from a list. See [Allow both custom and `pfm_range_list` values as input](#Allow-both-custom-and-pfm_range_list-values-as-input)

### Copy Description Text

Now payload key description text is selectable for copying & pasting.

### Develper: Show Payload Manifest in Finder

When you select a payload from the left sidebar, you can click 'Show Payload Manifest in Finder' from the Developer menu (this must be enabled first) to take you directly to the manifest file in the Finder.

### Donate Button

I have been asked multiple times to add a Donate button, so from this version there is a Donate button in the application preferences under General.

## Updated ProfileManifest Features

Vist the [Manifest Format Versions](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileManifests/wiki/Manifest-Format-Versions) to view all changes made to the manifest format used by ProfileCreator.

### ProfileManifest Subdomains

In some cases, there are payloads that are used for multiple purposes.  com.apple.MCX, for example, handles Energy Settings as well as Time Server & Mobile Accounts.  This provides the ability to separate preferences into different manifest files, but which all contribute to the same domain. (https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileManifests/issues/20)

- com.apple.MCX-EnergySettings
- com.apple.MCX-MobileAccounts
- com.apple.MCX-TimeServer

### Allow historical dates

Now you can supply a historical date for `date` preferences by setting `pfm_date_allow_past` key to `true`. (#129)

### Additional options for payload keys utilizing a `pfm_range_list`

#### Allow only unique values in an Array

The new key `pfm_value_unique` when set to `true` will only permit a given value to be added once within an array.  Support for additional input methods will be added in a later release (#146).

#### Allow both custom and `pfm_range_list` values as input

The new key `pfm_range_list_allow_custom_value` when set to `true` will allow the user to enter custom value(s) for a given preference while also selecting from the available `pfm_range_list` items.

#### Use slider as input method

To use a slider as the input method for a `pfm_range_list`, the new key: `pfm_view` must be set to `slider`.

### Support for value copy from other domains

The `pfm_value_copy` and `pfm_default_copy` keys now supports specifying the domain before the key path to be copied by using the `@` character as domain-keypath separator.

One example of this configuration are payloads that support for the identity payload. By specifying the following configuration in a payloads `IdentificationUUID` key, the value for the Identification payload's UUID will be automatically populated as the default value if the identity payload is added to the profile.

```xml
<key>pfm_default_copy</key>
<string>com.apple.configurationprofile.identification@PayloadUUID</string>
```

### Allow custom decimal places in number textfields.

The new key `pfm_value_decimal_places` will allow the manifest creator to specify the number of decimal places to show in the GUI. (#110)
